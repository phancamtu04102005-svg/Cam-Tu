# Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of historical sales transactions spanning 2011 to 2015, designed to support end-to-end business performance analysis. It consolidates key financial and commercial attributes, including revenue, profit, cost, sales volume, discount rates, customer segments, product groups, and sales regions into a structured analytical model.
# Objectives:
This analysis project aims to:
- Assess overall commercial performance.
- Identify structural trends over time.
- Evaluate customer segment economics.
- Analyze product and regional contribution.
- Examine the impact of discounting behavior.
# Tools used: Power BI
# Skills applied:
### Power BI – Data Cleaning (Power Query)
- Standardized numeric and date formats
- Removed missing and invalid values
- Cleaned and unified product group and customer segment labels
### Power BI – Data Modeling & DAX
- Built a structured data model for time, region, product, and customer analysis
- Created DAX measures: Total Revenue, Total Profit, Total Cost, Total Sales Quantity, Average Discount Rate
### Power BI – Visualization & Dashboarding
- KPI Cards for high-level performance tracking
- Bar, Column, Line, and Combo Charts
- Donut Charts for regional contribution
- Year slicer for interactive analysis
- Business-oriented dashboard layout and storytelling
# Key insights:
### 1. Growth Has Been Strong, but Shows Early Signs of Pressure
From 2011 to 2014, the business experienced consistent revenue and profit growth, indicating effective market expansion and product demand. However, in 2015, growth began to slow despite revenue remaining high.
This suggests the business may be reaching a maturity phase, where sustaining growth requires more aggressive pricing or promotions, rather than organic demand alone.
Business implication: 
Future growth will likely depend more on pricing strategy and customer value optimization than on volume growth.
### 2. Discounts Drive Volume, but Erode Profit Quality
Over time, the average discount rate increased, especially in the later years. While discounts supported revenue continuity, profit did not grow at the same pace.
This indicates diminishing returns from discounting, each additional unit of revenue is becoming less profitable.
Business implication:
Discounting is being used as a short-term sales lever, but at the cost of long-term margin sustainability. A more selective, segment-based discount strategy is required.
### 3. Customer Mix Is a Key Profit Lever
The Mass segment contributes the largest share of revenue due to high volume, but Gold and Platinum customers generate disproportionately higher profit per transaction.
This reveals that not all revenue is equally valuable. Profitability is strongly influenced by customer quality, not just sales volume.
Business implication:
Retaining and expanding high-tier customers will have a stronger impact on profitability than further expansion in the Mass segment.
### 4. Revenue Is Geographically Stable, Allowing Strategic Focus Elsewhere
Revenue distribution across regions is relatively balanced, with the North leading but not dominating. No single region represents a concentration risk.
Business implication:
Since regional performance is stable, management attention should shift from geographic expansion to pricing, customer segmentation, and product strategy.
### 5. Product Portfolio Relies on a Few Core Categories
A small number of product groups account for a significant portion of total revenue and profit. Other categories contribute marginally.
This concentration improves operational focus but increases dependency risk if demand for core products weakens.
Business implication:
The business must balance exploiting high-performing products while selectively developing underperforming categories to reduce revenue concentration risk.
# Strategic Recommendations:
### 1. Shift from Volume-Driven to Value-Driven Growth
- Reduce blanket discounting
- Align pricing strategy with customer lifetime value
### 2. Reallocate Sales Efforts Toward High-Value Customers
- Strengthen retention and loyalty programs for Gold and Platinum segments
- Use targeted offers instead of mass promotions
### 3. Improve Discount Governance
- Introduce discount thresholds tied to margin impact
- Monitor profit contribution alongside revenue in decision-making
### 4. Strengthen Product Portfolio Resilience
- Protect and optimize core product categories
- Pilot growth initiatives in smaller categories with clear ROI metrics
